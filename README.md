# Music Connoisseurs

# Descriptions:
An application that creates a database of music genres and provides a description to broaden your musical knowledge. The genres are user submitted along with descriptions and comments. Music videos to further illustrate the music genre are provided via a link to YouTube.
# User Story:
AS A Music Connoisseur. I WANT to expand my knowledge on musical genres. SO THAT I can further enjoy the music I listen to now and come across in the future.
# Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a fullstack web application that features an MVC paradigm and our own designed/built server-side API. We integrated the use of our own API with a third party API to further expand the capabilities of our intended web application. We are creating a database with information submitted by users and having it accessible to the same users.
# Functionality:
The functionality of the app is quite simple. All functionality is within one page. The music genres that are in the database are presented to the users in an array of buttons with the appropriate names. If a genre does not exist, users have a form at the bottom of the page to submit a new genre with a description and comment. If the user does find the genre they are looking for, they can click on the button with the desired genre to further reveal a description for the genre, a comment, and a link to youtube to see music videos of the musical genre chosen.
